# Interactive Rose

## ðŸ“œ _Description_

Just as a personal showcase, this repository will contain a portfolio of digital art crafted with `p5.js`, underpinned by the `Deno Runtime` using `JS(ES6)` and `TS(5.3)` files. Its objective is to archive digital artistry and demonstrate my creative abilities, alongside a passion for creating modern digital assets.

## ðŸ“¦ _Installation_

> ðŸ¦• Outlined below are the steps which presuppose that the `Deno Runtime` environment is already installed and set up on your local machine. If this is not the case, please refer to the `Deno Runtime` installation and environment documentation before proceeding to clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktortolini/interactive-rose.git
cd interactive-rose
deno cache serve.ts
```

## ðŸ”¥ _Usage Information_

Currently, the canvas displays a singular piece, purposefully chosen to introduce the concept and beauty of generative art, which is created through a combination of coding and user interaction. First, a blank canvas greets you ready to come alive as soon as you move your mouse. Each movement triggers unique iterations of the generative artwork.

## ðŸ¦• _Deno Deployment_

Encapsulated within the rapidly expanding _Deno Ecosystem_, which now boasts over 250,000 developers, this web application has been deployed on [Deno Deploy](https://interactive-rose.deno.dev/). As this repository grows to store more digital art the choice of `Deno Deploy` will offer a seamless experience for hosting and running `JS` and `TS` at the edge.
